## Contributions
By reading, analysing and using many of the tons of super high quality and amazing open source projects out there, we feel we learned so much from the wonderful open source community that we strongly feel the need to contribute back!

CloudLogger is our way to say "Thank you very much open source community for all the support for software development!".

As a member of the open source community, please help grow the community by using, sharing and contributing back to any of the tons of open source projects out there. The community altogether is super excited to see new, engaged members, and so are we at CloudLogger!

If you are interested in contributing to CloudLogger, for now help to spread the word and let others know about CloudLogger. Once CloudLogger is fully tested and verified to be working as expected, we'll start accepting contributions.

We're 100% commited to below software development rules:

- Simplicity
- Testable code
- Performance
- Tests, tests, tests!
	- Strong test suite covering all major code routes/branches
	- Strong focus to achieve 100% code coverage everywhere

On top of that, clean code is a must. No weird, obscure logic anywhere. As part of that principle, we avoid using comments to describe code logic as we strive to make the code so clean that any inline comments would just pollute the code (no need to explain what is very clear already!). The rule we follow is this: if we feel the need to add a comment to explain something, think again. That likely means the logic is too complex. Rethink and simplify it!
